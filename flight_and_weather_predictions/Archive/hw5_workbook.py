# MAGIC %md # Question 1: Distributed Graph Processing
# MAGIC Chapter 5 from Lin & Dyer gave you a high level introduction to graph algorithms and concernts that come up when trying to perform distributed computations over them. The questions below are designed to make sure you captured the key points from this reading and your async lectures. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q1 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Give an example of a dataset that would be appropriate to represent as a graph. What are the nodes/edges in this dataset? Is the graph you describe 'directed' or 'undirected'? What would the average "in-degree" of a node mean in the context of your example? 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Other than their size/scale, what makes graphs uniquely challenging to work with in the map-reduce paradigm? *(__HINT__: Do not respond in terms of any specific algorithm. Think in terms of the nature of the graph datastructure itself).*
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ Briefly describe Dijskra's algorithm (goal/approach). What specific design component makes this approach hard to parallelize?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ How does parallel breadth-first-search get around the problem that you identified in part `c`? At what expense?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q1 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ A dataset that would be appropriate to represent as a graph is Twitch viewing data. The nodes in the Twitch dataset would streamers and the edges would be viewers. The graph would be directed since many viewers can watch a streamer without the streamer watching the viewers content. The average in-degree of a node in the context of the Twitch dataset would be the average number of viewers a streamer has.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ Graphs are uniquely challenging to work with in map-reduce paradigms due to inter connected nature of the graphs. Map-reduce distributes the processing and much of the algorithms benefits come from parallelization which is hindered by graphs iterative, interconnected, and mostly iterative nature when being built.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ Dijskra's algorithms goal is to determine a nodes shortest path to another node. The algorithms approach is to evaluate all connected nodes then visits the node with shortest distance repeating the process until it reaches the desired node while tracking the progress in a global priority queue to backtrack if the current path does not produce the desired result. The reliance on the previous step to determine the next step while keeping track of the progress makes parellilization difficult.  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ Parallel breadth-first-search gets around the problem in part c by ignoring the global priority queue and visiting all nodes in order of they are seen on the graph and tracking each subsequent node along with the distance then reduces to the shortest path. The expense is the compute power/time because this method is essentially a brute force technique that will calculate a lot of dead ends.  

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md # Question 2: Representing Graphs 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In class you saw examples of adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of graphs. These data structures were probably familiar from HW3, though we hadn't before talked about them in the context of graphs. In this question we'll discuss some of the tradeoffs associated with these representations. __`NOTE:`__ We'll use the graph from Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer as a toy example. For convenience in the code below we'll label the nodes `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` instead of $n_1$, $n_2$, etc but otherwise you should be able to follow along & check our answers against those in the text.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q2 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ Relatively speaking, is the graph you described in Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer "sparse" or "dense"?  Explain how sparsity/density impacts the adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of a graph.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ Run the provided code to create and plot our toy graph. Is this graph directed or undirected? Explain how the adjacency matrices for directed graphs will differ from those of undirected graphs.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) code:__ Fill in the missing code to complete the function `get_adj_matr()`.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code:__ Fill in the missing code to complete the function `get_adj_list()`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q2 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ The graph I describe according to Lin & Dyer would be sparse. The sparsity/density impacts adjacency matrix interpretability and memory usage because the more sparse the matrix the more zeros that reduces interpretability and uses more memory than necessary but is useful as the density increases. The sparsity/density impacts adjacency list in an inversed way compared to the matrix (increased density makes it harder to interpert and uses more memory) and is useful when the data is sparser.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The graph is directed. The adjacency matrices for directed graphs differ from undirected graphs in the matrix shape. The matrix for an undirected graph will have key parity between the x and y axis which makes the matrix symmetrical while a directed graph matrix is asymetrical due to the lack of key parity between x and y axis.

# MAGIC %md # Question 3: Markov Chains and Random Walks
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you know from your readings and in class discussions, the PageRank algorithm takes advantage of the machinery of Markov Chains to compute the relative importance of a webpage using the hyperlink structure of the web (we'll refer to this as the 'web-graph'). A Markov Chain is a discrete-time stochastic process. The stochastic matrix has a principal left eigen vector corresponding to its largest eigen value which is one. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector. This steady state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding webpage. In this question we'll briefly discuss a few concepts that are key to understanding the math behind PageRank. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Q3 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) short response:__ It is common to explain PageRank using the analogy of a web surfer who clicks on links at random ad infinitum. In the context of this hypothetical infinite random walk, what does the PageRank metric measure/represent?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__ What is the "Markov Property" and what does it mean in the context of PageRank?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ A Markov chain consists of $n$ states plus an $n\times n$ transition probability matrix. In the context of PageRank & a random walk over the WebGraph what are the $n$ states? what implications does this have about the size of the transition matrix?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) code + short response:__ What is a "right stochastic matrix"? Fill in the code below to compute the transition matrix for the toy graph from question 2. [__`HINT:`__ _It should be right stochastic. Using numpy this calculation can be done in one line of code._]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) code + short response:__ To compute the stable state distribution (i.e. PageRank) of a "nice" graph we can apply the power iteration method - repeatedly multiplying the transition matrix by itself, until the values no longer change. Apply this strategy to your transition matrix from `part d` to find the PageRank for each of the pages in your toy graph. Your code should print the results of each iteration. How many iterations does it take to converge? Which node is most 'central' (i.e. highest ranked)? Does this match your intuition? 
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 1:`__ _this is a naive approach, we'll unpack what it means to be "nice" in the next question_.
# MAGIC     * __`NOTE 2:`__ _no need to implement a stopping criteria, visual inspection should suffice_.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q3 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ The PageRank metric ranks the relative importance of each page within the WebGraph. The relative importance is measured by how frequently a page would be encountered.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The Markov Property is the when the next state does not depend on a sequence of events but only on the current state (memoryless). In the context of PageRank, only the current web page can determine where the user clicks next or teleports if there's no options.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ The n states are the number of web pages (nodes). This implies the size of the transition matrix is the number of web pages times the number of web pages. Which is huge considering the size of the web.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ A right stochastic matrix is a real square matrix, with each row summing to 1.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __e)__ It takes 50 iterations to converge. The most central node is E. This matches my intuition because it has the most edges.

# MAGIC %md # Question 4: Page Rank Theory
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Seems easy right? Unfortunately applying this power iteration method directly to the web-graph actually runs into a few problems. In this question we'll tease apart what we meant by a 'nice graph' in Question 3 and highlight key modifications we'll have to make to the web-graph when performing PageRank. To start, we'll look at what goes wrong when we try to repeat our strategy from question 3 on a 'not nice' graph.

# MAGIC ### Q4 Tasks:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __a) code + short response:__ Run the provided code to create and plot our 'not nice' graph. Fill in the missing code to compute its transition matrix & run the power iteration method from question 3. What is wrong with what you see? [__`HINT:`__ _there is a visible underlying reason that it isn't converging... try adding up the probabilities in the state vector after each iteration._]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __b) short response:__  Identify the dangling node in this 'not nice' graph and explain how this node causes the problem you described in 'a'. How could we modify the transition matrix after each iteration to prevent this problem?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __c) short response:__ What does it mean for a graph to be irreducible? Is the webgraph naturally irreducible? Explain your reasoning briefly.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __d) short response:__ What does it mean for a graph to be aperiodic? Is the webgraph naturally aperiodic? Explain your reasoning briefly.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * __e) short response:__ What modification to the webgraph does PageRank make in order to guarantee aperiodicity and irreducibility? Interpret this modification in terms of our random surfer analogy.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Q4 Student Answers:
# MAGIC > __a)__ We're losing probability mass with each iteration.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __b)__ The dangling node is 'D'. We could modify the transition matrix by redistributing the lost mass evenly to all nodes. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __c)__ In an irreducible graph you can go from any state to other states. A Markov chain is said to be irreducible if its state space is a single communicating class. A webgraph is not naturally irreducible. There could be pages that have yet to be crawled resulting in dangling nodes. There could also be naturally occuring dangling nodes like downloads, images, movies etc.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __d)__ In an aperiodic graph, the greatest common divisor of all cycle lengths is 1. A webgraph is not naturally aperiodic. Similar to what was mentioned above, because there could be pages that have yet to be crawled, this could result in periodicity. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC > __e)__ The modifications to help guarantee aperiodicity and irreducibiliity is to implement teleportation and adding self loops. This would allow the random surfer to "teleport" out of dangling nodes in the form of entering a new URL and self loops.
